                    This was my first big python project that gave no guidance on what the final product was supposed to be. I worked alongside a group
                    and we decided to create a financial tracker. This allowed us to work with finances as objects and create a simple GUI for the user
                    to use our product easily.

                         the player as they venture through the game.

                        This project was for my human-centered design class. My team and I started with an idea (a portal where pet owners could access
                        their pet's medical information uploaded by their vet), and went from low to high fidelity wireframes to bring the idea to life. We 
                        conducted contextual inquiries and analysis to improve and iterate on our design and created a final prototype in Figma.

                        This was the final group project for my dynamic web development class. We did not have an assignment but rather a broad set of requirements 
                        such as using two APIs and connecting the code to a Supabase database we created. With these requirements, we decided to create a sort of book 
                        reccommender/database. It utilizes the Gutundex and Open Library APIs to find and display information (title, author, cover) about the most popular
                        books both generally and based off of a specified genre. The site requires the CORS extension to run the fetches but the code can still be viewed from GitHub.

                        behind metadata organization. Not only did this project teach me about how data is stored and organized, but it also introduced me to creating artifacts similar
                        to personas and analyzing important information about our app such as the audience, the stakeholders, the goal, and more.

                        This project was for a board game that my team created for a school project. I took on the responsibility of creating the game cards which contained all the
                        information for each character. I designed the cards in Figma and kept each draft of the design as I went through the process. After I observed playtesting with
                        the initial high-fidelity prototypes, I continued to improve upon the cards to create the most intuitive deck possible.
